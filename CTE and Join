This is a SQL query showcasing a common table expression with both left and inner joins:

WITH top_5_cust_table (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country)
AS (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.city, E.country, 
SUM(B.amount) AS total_payments
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN payment B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON A.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule%',
'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM(B.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country, COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, 
COUNT (DISTINC D.country) AS top_5_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_cust_table ON D.country = top_5_cust_table.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
