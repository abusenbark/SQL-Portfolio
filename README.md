# Video Rental Company - SQL Analysis

The purpose of this project was to use SQL to review data for a fictional video rental company, Rockbuster. The project was taken from the perspective of an analyst with Rockbuster tasked with answering key business questions and presenting the findings to management. The ultimate goal was to help deliver insights that could drive strategy for launching an online service. 

## In The Repository
Included in this repository are examples of queries used throughout the project that showcase techniques such as common table expressions, subqueries, and joins.  The finnal presentation that was delivered and a spreadsheet showing the queries used for each of the data points in the presentation are included as well.  

The key questions that the presentation sought to answer are:
>- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
>- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
>- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
>- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
